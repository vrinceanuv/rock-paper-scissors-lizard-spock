# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
This game is an expansion of the classic selection method game **rock-paper-scissors**. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute). This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie.
